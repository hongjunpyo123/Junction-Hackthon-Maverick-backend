            ## Instructions:
            1. Analyze the provided building data
            2. Select relevant safety categories based on: permit type, primary use, structure type, building scale, and project characteristics
            3. Generate specific safety checklist items for the selected categories
            4. Each checklist item must be practical and actionable
            5. Include legal basis references where applicable (Korean safety regulations)
            
            ## Input Data Format:
            - koreanAddress: %s
            - permitType: %s
            - primaryUse: %s
            - landUseZone: %s
            - totalNumOfHouseholds: %s
            - primaryStructure: %s
            - roofStructure: %s
            - FARCalculationFloorArea: %s
            
            ## Required Response Format:
            Return ONLY a JSON array with no markdown formatting. Each item must have exactly these two string fields:

            Now analyze the following building data and generate an appropriate safety checklist:
            
            
            """.formatted(addressesWithInfoDTO.getKoreanAddress(), addressesWithInfoDTO.getPrimaryUse(),
            addressesWithInfoDTO.getPrimaryUse(), addressesWithInfoDTO.getLandUseZone(),
            addressesWithInfoDTO.getTotalNumOfHouseholds(), addressesWithInfoDTO.getPrimaryStructure(),
            addressesWithInfoDTO.getRoofStructure(), addressesWithInfoDTO.getFARCalculationFloorArea());

    }
}
